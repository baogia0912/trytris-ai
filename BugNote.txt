bug 1: the ghost piece start from 1 space above the correct position and then drop down one to the correct position 

(fixed by changing one of the number in the ghost piece function in the y coordinate calculation)

bug 2: the hard drop does not lock in right away but wait for the falldown time to kick in

(fixed by appling the lockin function after the spacebar is hitted)

bug 3: when implementing the 7 bag system, the bag reset after every draw

(fixed by updating the bag after every draws)

bug 4: when implementing the hold function the hold piece remember the x, y and rotation before hold which generate undesirable flaws

(fixed by reseting the hold piece's x, y and rotation after each hold)

bug 5: when implementing 4 more next peice, the next piece function as wanted but does not update on screen

(fixed by redrawing each next peice at the same time the screen update)

bug 6: when implementing the Super Rotation System, if the piece can not be fit after all 5 test, the pieces locked in at the first test

(fixed by rotate the piece back to its original rotation if all 5 tests are invalid)

bug 7: the piece spawns above the board so some piece goes off the screen and crash the game

(fixed by making the board 40 in height)

bug 8: the game crash when the time of the piece lock in and any other action that need a piece overlap

(fixed by putting a none piece check in the checking for valid position fuction and other function that require a piece to do calculation)

bug 9: when implementing 2 players mode, the pieces land but disapear

(fixed by giving both players their own board, move, bag, hold, next piece and key input)

bug 10: when implementing flash special move, the flash freeze up the game without updating

(fixed by making the special moves its own appearing time to check for time to disapear)
